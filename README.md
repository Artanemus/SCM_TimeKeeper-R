SCMTimeKeeper is a 64bit application written in pascal on a cross platform compiler (FireMonkey). It's part of an eco system of applications that make up the SwimClubMeet project. SCM lets amateur swimming clubs manage members and run their club night's.

To learn more about SCM view the [github pages](https://artanemus.github.io/index.html).

Currently the only platform available is Windows. Future releases of the SCM_TimeKeeper may include Android and iOS. This application runs best on a touch tablet.

### USING BMAC

After install, by default, an icon is placed on the desktop. If you elected to disable this, type **time** in the windows search bar to discover it. Else navigate to the **Artanemus** folder on the start bar. (All SCM applications and utilities are located in this folder.)

### ON START-UP

The application will ask you to login to the database. If you are running on a touch-pad, bring the application to full screen - you'll notice it will zoomed (scaled up) making it easier to navigate and enter data. Currently there is no help file for this application.

Browse the events and heats to locate the entrant. When entering time, **don't use : or leading zeros.** Characters enter right to left in the display. As well as touch screen, the numpad can be used. You must post your changes for qualification to be enacted.

There's also a stop watch - why? I don't know. ðŸ˜€

Closed heats cannot be edited.

> Use Windows **Apps and Features** to remove the application.
